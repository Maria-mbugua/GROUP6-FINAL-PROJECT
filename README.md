 Group 6 Final project on the Data Science Prep Course.
 

IMPROVING SCHOOL INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE UNITED STATES.

OVERVIEW

The US system of education consists of Primary and Secondary School which constitute a total of 12 years. These are referred to as grade one to grade twelve. Students begin primary school, commonly referred to as elementary school, from around the age of 6. Secondary school entails Junior/ Middle School and High school. After graduation from high school, students move on to college or University.

According to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), there are 98,755 public schools, 13,477 middle schools, 2,500 Junior high schools, and 23900Secondary Schools in the US.  
As a way to improve education in the US, we look at the number of teachers in schools that are currently registered in various cities in the US. 

School infrastructure aids in the quality of education in an institution, they may entail teachers,  classrooms, laboratories, open fields for games and physical education, and sanitation facilities. This project analyses  the two data sets that we have : one containing the population by city and another containing the list of schools and the cities they are in, and another consisting of the number of teachers per state. Our data seeks to identify specific cities and states that require more teachers within their schools to ensure provision of quality education in the cities, states and country in general.
