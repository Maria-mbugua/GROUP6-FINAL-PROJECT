## Description

According to the World Bank, the US Population increases steadily at a rate of 0.4% annually across the 50 states. This implies that despite the number of people within an area increasing, the facilities i.e schools, remain the same in size and infrastructure, and this will eventually lead to a strain on the facilities.
On this project, we seek to identify the number and names of cities and schools that are overwhelmed when it comes to school infrastructure due to the increased population in the area. Throughout this project, we should be able to develop a priority list for the upscaling and upgrading of infrastructure in the cities and states at large.


## Setup/Installation Requirements

A Google Jupyter notebook collab  which is on the Google application is required for running the Python commands.
On the Jupyter notebook use the commands below so that you can be able to get the output of  python commands.
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

## Technologies used

Python programming language was used in loading the datasets in the Jupyter notebook. It was also used in the process of understanding the data from the datasets.
It's also used in the process of data cleanning and data analysis of the datasets. This was all to attain our  objectives.
